## The value of diversity

This blog consists of my opinions formed by my own experience. If your
experience differ then that should be celebrated. Development is a diverse
problem-space with many viable solutions that change over time.

If you have any suggestions I'd love to hear them. Having a diverse set of
perspectives is a great way to avoid common pitfalls linked to technical debt.

 - premature abstractions
 - premature optimization
 
 Once the prototype has found product market fit it has achieved it's purpose.
 This is a great time to review the models and fix the biggest inconsistencies.
 with some duplication
 
 I often prefer a total rewrite of a prototype over restructuring a pile

## The value of teaching

The best way to learn something is to teach it. The act of explaining topics in
a simple manner will reveal gaps in your understanding. The gaps are usually
small enough that you can be productive at your job without addressing them. But
I find that a clear understanding of the underlying principles makes the process
of learning new tools easier.

A passion for learning is essential for any developer who wants to write quality
code efficiently.

The goal of learning is to change our perspective and iterate.
