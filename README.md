## Project Structure

Astro looks for `.astro` or `.md` files in the `src/pages/` directory. Each page is exposed as a route based on its file name.

Any static assets, like images, can be placed in the `public/` directory.

All blog posts are stored in `src/content/blog` directory.

## 🚀 Getting started

- Install the package manager - `npm install -g pnpm`
- Install the dependencies - `pnpm i`
- Build the site - `pnpm build`
- Now you are ready to get started - `pnpm run dev`

## 🧞 Commands

All commands are run from the root of the project, from a terminal:

- `pnpm install` - Installs dependencies
- `pnpm test` - Runs the playwright e2e tests
- `pnpm run dev` - Starts local dev server at `localhost:3000`
- `pnpm run build` - Build your production site to `./dist/`
- `pnpm run preview` - Preview your build locally, before deploying
