## 🚀 Project Structure

Astro looks for `.astro` or `.md` files in the `src/pages/` directory. Each page is exposed as a route based on its file name.

Any static assets, like images, can be placed in the `public/` directory.

All blog posts are stored in `src/content/blog` directory.

## 🧞 Commands

All commands are run from the root of the project, from a terminal:

- `pnpm install` - Installs dependencies
- `pnpm test` - Runs the playwright e2e tests
- `pnpm run dev` - Starts local dev server at `localhost:3000`
- `pnpm run build` - Build your production site to `./dist/`
- `pnpm run preview` - Preview your build locally, before deploying
- `pnpm run format:check` - Check code format with Prettier
- `pnpm run format` - Format codes with Prettier
- `pnpm run sync` - Generates TypeScript types for all Astro modules. [Learn more](https://docs.astro.build/en/reference/cli-reference/#astro-sync).
