## Welcome

I'm excited to announce the launch of my new blog about software development.
The blog will mostly be about the Javascript ecosystem but I'll experiment with
the along the way. This post starts by outlining the content topics and proceeds
by summarizing my guiding principles. Hopefully this gives you a better idea of what to expect going forward.

## Content plan

- Short tutorials
- Summaries of technical trade-offs
- NPM package reviews
- Best developer resources
- Coverage of emerging trends

## Disclaimer

The information presented in this blog is based on my own personal experience.
Please bear in mind that any recommendations have to be adapted to the specific
constraints of your situation.

## Question assumptions

- No solution should be applied blindly
- No principle is above scrutiny
- Challenge established practices by reasoning from first principles

## Focus on fundamentals

- Fundamentals are more widely applicable
- Specific details have shorter lifespan

## Optimize for novelty

- Every situation is unique
- Developers often encounter new systems
- Change is the only constant

## Source citation policy

Strict citation policy will not be enforced but I will try to suggest good resources for further study.

## Beginners mind

It is impossible to learn everything about software in a lifetime. Even the most experienced
developers regularly reach the limits of their expertise. Being confident with
this fact can decrease the risk of burnout and makes the process more fun.

Zen buddhism exemplifies this concept with "the beginners mind".

> “If your mind is empty, it is always ready for anything; it is open to everything. In the beginner’s mind there are many possibilities; in the expert’s mind there are few.”

**Shunryu Suzuki,**

**[Zen Mind, Beginner's Mind](https://www.goodreads.com/work/quotes/231282)**

Is it a statement on the creative demands of the hacker ethos? It's only fitting
if the producer of 0-day vulnrabilities requires an empty mind, if you ask me.

## Conclusion

My new blog provides an in-depth look at some of the most popular tools and packages so that readers can gain a better understanding of how they work—and when they should be used.

I hope this will be valuable for beginners and veterans alike and I look forward
to learning together.
