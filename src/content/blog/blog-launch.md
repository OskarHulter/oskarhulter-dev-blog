## Welcome

I'm excited to announce the launch of my new blog about software development.

The content of this blog will focus on

- tutorials
- reviews of packages & services
- my pick of the best dev resources
- spicy takes on the latest trends

Whether you are an experienced developer or just getting started, this blog will
provide valuable insights into the why and how of modern software development.

In this post I'll tell you a bit about what inspired this blog.

## Disclaimer

This blog consists of my opinions formed by my own experience. If your
experience differ then that should be celebrated. Development is a diverse
problem-space with many viable solutions that change over time.
The goal of learning is to change our perspective and iterate. 
"Strong opinions, weakly Held".

The driving motivation behind this blog is to hone my craft and help others
do the same. Any advice and suggestions should be adapted to the
situation you face. You are free to pick and choose what works for you.

I mainly deal with observations from my own experience in the field. This should
be taken as practical advice that can help you in the process of forming your own conclusions.
I will cite the most important sources of information but I will not apply
strict citations in the effort to produce lighthearted and digestable content.

 In the interest of time I will portray one perspective as the "best" but
the most apropriate solution should always be adapted to the specific constraints of the
situation.

No solution should be applied blindly and no principle is above scrutiny. If
your experience differs from mine I would be glad if you provide me with
feedback. This way we can improve the material together and draw upon a
more diverse perspective, which is an important part of problem solving.

## Goals

The best way to learn something is to teach it. The act of explaining topics in
a simple manner will reveal gaps in your understanding. The gaps are usually
small enough that you can be productive at your job without fixing them. But a clear
understanding of the underlying principles makes the process of learning new
tools easier.

Fundamental concepts over specific details

- They are more applicable
- They don't change as often

Optimize for new situations

- Change is the only constant
- Every situation will be new, at least once
- Every situation is unique


## Guiding principle

It is impossible to learn everything about software in a lifetime. Even the most experienced
developers regularly reach the limits of their expertise. Being confident with
this fact can decrease the risk of burnout and makes the process more fun.

Zen buddhism exemplifies this concept with "the beginners mind".

> “If your mind is empty, it is always ready for anything; it is open to everything. In the beginner’s mind there are many possibilities; in the expert’s mind there are few.”

―

**Shunryu Suzuki,**

**[Zen Mind, Beginner's Mind](https://www.goodreads.com/work/quotes/231282)**

Is it a statement on the creative demands of the hacker ethos? It's only fitting
if the producer of 0-day vulnrabilities requires an empty mind, if you ask me.


## Conclusion

A passion for learning is essential for any developer who wants to write quality
code efficiently.

My new blog provides an in-depth look at some of the most popular tools and packages so that readers can gain a better understanding of how they work—and when they should be used.

I hope this will be valuable for beginners and veterans alike and I look forward
to learning together.

Let's get nerdy! 🤓
