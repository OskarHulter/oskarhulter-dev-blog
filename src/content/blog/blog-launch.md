## Welcome

I'm excited to announce the launch of my new blog about software development.

The content will focus on the following:

- tutorials & explainations
- reviews of packages & services
- my pick of the best dev resources
- spicy takes on the latest trends

Whether you are an experienced developer or just getting started,
this blog will provide valuable insights into the why and how of common code patterns.

## Why create a blog?

In this post I'll tell you a bit about why I started this blog.

You're probably wondering, "Does the world need another blog?"

By sharing my story I hope to help other developers learn and grow.



## Goals

The best way to learn something is to teach it. The act of explaining
topics in a simple manner will reveal gaps in your understanding. The gaps are
usually small enough that you can be productive at your job without fixing them.
A clear understanding of the underlying principles makes the process of learning
new technologies easier.


Fundamental concepts vs specific details

- Are more applicable
- Don't change as often
- Fundamentals

Optimizing for new situations makes sense because of two main reasons.

- Change is the only constant.
- Every situation will be new, at least once.
- Every organization has unique constraints. (projects)

It is impossible to learn everything about software in a lifetime. Even the most experienced
developers regularly reach the limits of their expertise. Being confident with
this fact can decrease the risk of burnout and makes the process more fun.

Zen buddhism celebrates the concept of "the beginners mind" - a state bescribed
by the poem:

> “If your mind is empty, it is always ready for anything; it is open to everything. In the beginner’s mind there are many possibilities; in the expert’s mind there are few.”

―

**Shunryu Suzuki,**

**[Zen Mind, Beginner's Mind](https://www.goodreads.com/work/quotes/231282)**

Is it a statement on the creative demands of the hacker ethos? It's only fitting
that a 0-day vulnrability requires an empty mind.

If you have any questions or comments, please feel free to contact me!

## Conclusion

A passion for learning is essential for any developer who wants to write quality
code efficiently.

My new blog provides an in-depth look at some of the most
popular tools, patterns and packages so that readers can gain a better
understanding of how they work—and when they should be used.

I hope this will be valuable for beginners and veterans alike and I look forward
to learning together. Let's get nerdy! 🤓
